# AutomatedYoutube

So basically the working of this program is like this 
we are using pyttsx3 module to convert the quote scraped form https://zenquotes.io/api/random and then we have a video in the same directory named vid.mp4 which is a 2k video which will be added with the audio named test.mp3 created by pyttsx3 module.

And after that the video will be uploaded to youtube with the help of youtube api
to know more about the youtube api reffer to https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3
